# SCP SL Exiled Template

> [!Important]
> You **must know the basics of C#** before using this template — but you can try!

Also, if you ever get stuck somewhere, **talk to yourself and try to explain what the code is doing — it can help!**

This is a beginner-friendly template for creating SCP:SL EXILED plugins.

A valuable resource is the [EXILED Docs](https://github.com/ExMod-Team/EXILED/tree/master/EXILED/docs/articles/plugins) and the EXILED Discord server: [Exiled Discord](https://discord.gg/j5Zc992ZgM)
